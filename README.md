ModdishLauncher
===============

The launcher for the Moddish Modpack. 

What it does: 
- Asks you to login
- Downloads Minecraft
- Downloads mods and installs them
- Runs Minecraft

To do: 
- Get mods permissions
- If I don't have permission for mods, request manual download for the mods in question.
- Retrieve modlist and URLs from the internet
- Launcher update system
- Update for 1.6 compatibility? (Maybe I'll hold off until the mods start coming out for a particular version... if this IS 1.6, then I'll change the code for 1.6)
