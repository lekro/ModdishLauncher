ModdishLauncher
===============

The launcher for the Moddish Modpack. 

What it does: 
- Asks you to login
- Downloads Minecraft
- Downloads mods and installs them
- Runs Minecraft

To do: 
- Get mods permissions
- If I don't have permission for mods, request manual download for the mods in question.
- Retrieve modlist and URLs from the internet
- Launcher update system
- Update for 1.6 compatibility? (Maybe I'll hold off until the mods start coming out for a particular version... if this IS 1.6, then I'll change the code for 1.6)

Wow! I really didn't know that 1.6 was going to bring all this new stuff! So I'm going to see what the launcher does... (peeks at code) and try to update this too!
